## Getting Started

Welcome to V1.1 of the QR Code game. This file does officially fit and work in a qr code. Now all you got to do is compile it. more features will be added to the game in the later days. But for now the original source code has been compressed into fitting into a QR Code

## Testing
While you wait you can get the jist of the game by downloading the source code, and in the 'src' folder you can run the .java file with "java .\Game.java" without the quotes of course!!
